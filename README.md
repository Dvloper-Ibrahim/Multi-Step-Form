## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

At first, I wanted to implement the challenge using a framework or library like `React.js`.

But to get some challenging tasks and face more confused bugs , I used vanilla javascript so as to being familiar with these bugs.

### Continued development

I'm planning for setting an algorithm that force the user to input his personal info (name, email, phone) in some way and get more valid data from him.

### Useful resources

- [Responsive Web Design - Media Queries](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) - This helped me for responsive design and I want to know the standard dimensions for the media queries.
